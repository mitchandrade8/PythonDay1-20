# MARK: - Indentation and the scope of it

# Example #1:

# def my_function():
#   print("Hello")
#   print("World")

# Example #2:

# def my_function():
#   print("Hello")
# print("World")

# MARK: - Breakdown

# The small indentation difference from example 1 to example 2 changes the printed output to the console.
# The 2nd example only has one print statement in the function
